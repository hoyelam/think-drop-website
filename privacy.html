                            Thank you for using Thinkdrop built by Hoye Lam (“I”, “we”, “us”, “our”, "Thinkdrop" or “Thinkdrop 2”). Thinkdrop does not and will never share personal content unless permission is given by the user (“customer”). 
                            All thoughts are encrypted and stored locally within the user’s device and/or private iCloud and thus can’t be accessed by us or any other third party services unless permission is given. Any thought deletion will also be immediately removed and thus can’t be recovered. All personal content are thus private, secure and not accessible by any party other than the user.
